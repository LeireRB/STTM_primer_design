"""
Code created by Leire Rivero Brouard to automatize miRNA design for expression in plants based on
Zhao, J. et al(2020) Potato Virus X-Based microRNA Silencing (VbMS) In Potato.


The code follows the instructions to design short tandem target mimics (STTM)
for directed degradation of specific miRNAs.

The code prompts for miRNA sequences and determines the most suitable bulge sequence according to empirical data,
asks the user to decide whether to implement LIC cassette sequence or restriction sites for future insertion of the STTM molecules in plasmids
and finally outputs the primers required for amplification STTM.
